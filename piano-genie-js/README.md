# Piano Genie Demo

This directory used to host our interactive demo for [Piano Genie](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/pianogenie).

We now have a better demo available at [piano-genie.glitch.me](http://piano-genie.glitch.me). It was built with the Piano Genie model in [Magenta JS](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta-js/tree/master/music).

If you are interested in our old demo which featured *all* of the models from our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05246), you can still find it [here](https://chrisdonahue.github.io/piano-genie-research-demo/) ([code](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/piano-genie-research-demo/)).
